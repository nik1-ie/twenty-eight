        <p>(if you're not burning the shit outta my poor brain)</p>
        <br>
        <p>honestly after everything ive said when i turned eighteen myself, i wouldnt be surprised it you tell me that you're scared of it</p>
        <p>growing up <i>is</i> scary, and i'll never come back on that statement</p>
        <p>but hell, living is also scary, and when you think about it enough, every thing is scary</p>
        <p>so when fear paralyses you, keep moving</p>
        <p>do it scared.</p> <br>
        <p>i hope we can keep yapping for a long time like this, even if college takes both our time up</p>
        <p>i hope college experience will be good to you, and not the traumatizing usual stem experience people talk about</p>
        <p>i hope you study things you like and stay interested in what you loved studying</p>
        <p>i hope your lil spark keeps burning, and remember that if it ever dies down, i'll keep a lighter in case you need it :D</p>
        <p>so don't worry too much about the future twin, wtv happen you'll land back on your feet for sure</p>
        <p>i hope uve given urseld the credit you deserve and that you don't forget what a golden person you are</p>
